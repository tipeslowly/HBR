His panoramas are filled with playful but elegiac meditations on the theme of the Chinese landscape, expressed in luminescent swirls of colour and cascading ink.\nAn examination of Hou Beiren’s life in ink offers a personal history of splashed ink landscape painting in light of the mid-twentieth century revival of this mode of painting and its future trajectory. Developed in conjunction with a display of Hou Beiren’s paintings (16 May–26 June 2020) at UMAG, this presentation of recent work was especially poignant, as the artist had spent several formative years in Hong Kong in the early 1950s prior to departing for America. Today, Hou Beiren lives in northern California, where he continues to paint in his beloved Old Apricot Villa, his home and studio for over 50 years.\nThe catalogue section of this platform includes all of Hou Beiren's paintings currently held by UMAG.\nSupport for the development of this online platform was generously provided by a 2020-21 Knowledge Exchange grant from The University of Hong Kong.\n","id":0,"length":201,"title":"Cover","type":"cover","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/HBR/"},{"content":"  Hou Beiren painting in his studio at the Old Apricot Villa   fullscreen   Hou Beiren painting in his studio at the Old Apricot Villa    In the early twentieth century, Chinese ink painting came to be termed ‘national painting’ (guohua) or Chinese painting (zhongguo hua) to distinguish it from Western forms (xihua), and to describe the ink painting tradition inherited from imperial China with its long-defined styles and subject matters of figures, landscapes and flower-and-bird motifs. Debate around the role and nature of China’s guohua painting grew in response to the perceived challenge of Western art. One of the particular fascinations of ink painting is that it is not a unified inheritance, but rather a multiplicity of practises and methods, lineages and schools, idioms and styles.\nToward the end of the twentieth and into the twenty-first century, ink painting has continued to develop and react in response to the globalisation and hybridisation of contemporary Chinese art. New terms and classifications have been applied to ink painting including ‘ink art’ (shuimo yishu) and ‘experimental ink painting’ (shiyan shuimo) to describe the use of traditional materials in combination with the conceptual, postmodern, abstract and multi-media artmaking forms and strategies of Western and global contemporary art that are no longer adequately defined or described by guohua categories. The still evolving boundaries of ink painting have expanded remarkably and innovatively into areas that can challenge simple or inherited definitions, though ink painting has yet to fully supersede and shake off the earlier category of guohua and its part in the dichotomy of Chinese and Western.\n Lake Tai Sunset | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 1992   fullscreen   Lake Tai Sunset | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 1992    The issues and complexities of artistic classification, as well as of cultural identity, have been compounded by transnational Chinese artists living outside China who are able to choose from an open-ended range of cultural references, media and materials, and also find themselves negotiating multi-faceted and overlapping expressions of Chinese and globalised artistic identities in which any established definition of what constitutes Chinese painting has been radically expanded, posing significant challenges for both artists and audiences.1 On the other hand, it has been observed that a “substantial portion of art production today in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and overseas is not ‘new’ but ‘traditional’” and that “it both perpetuates and aims gradually, gently, to modernize.” 2\nNotes   For a more extensive and in-depth discussion of the histories and usages of these key terms, see Chan 2013.

In September of 1945, he then became editor at Reincarnation (Zaisheng), a Guomindang-affiliated journal based in Shanghai, which claimed that “national revival was its direction, and it proposed detailed and systematic plans of national revival for readers’ deliberation.”7\n Visiting the Mountain, Fu Baoshi (1904–1965), painted in Chongqing in the mid-1940s just before Fu returned to Nanjing |   fullscreen   Visiting the Mountain, Fu Baoshi (1904–1965), painted in Chongqing in the mid-1940s just before Fu returned to Nanjing | The Metropolitan Museum of Art | 2019.290.10     Following the Japanese surrender in August 1945, the Guomindang government decided to relocate from its temporary capital in Chongqing back to Nanjing in May of 1946. While in Chongqing, Hou appears to have had some involvement in the January 10, 1946 Conference for Political Dialogue, which involved representatives of the Guomindang, Chinese Communist Party (CCP) and the China Democratic League. In late 1946, Hou also was involved in the drafting of the revised 5 May 1936 Constitution Draft, and he served in the role of legislator until his resignation in 1947, whereupon he returned to Beijing with his wife Zhang Yunqin, whom he had married in 1946.8\nNotes   In a 1986 interview, Hou states that he studied at Japan’s Kyushu University in Kyoto from 1936–39, going on to say that his studies were related to the links between Chinese and Japanese culture. See Yu 1986: 59.

Along with countless others, Hou Beiren and his wife joined the exodus to Hong Kong and Taiwan. Hou was also an author, and in 1954 he published a novel in Hong Kong entitled Homeland Springtime (Guguo de chuntian) under the pseudonym Duanmu Qing.3\n Hou Beiren in Hong Kong with (left to right) Lu Guangsheng, member of the Hong Kong National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, Wu Xianzi and Kang Youwei’s disciple Lu Yuan, 1956   fullscreen   Hou Beiren in Hong Kong with (left to right) Lu Guangsheng, member of the Hong Kong National Committee of the Chinese People’s Political Consultative Conference, Wu Xianzi and Kang Youwei’s disciple Lu Yuan, 1956    Hou edited or contributed to several other publications dealing with art and culture during this period, later describing life in Hong Kong as extremely difficult, and that he had found it hard to make a living.4 In 1955, Hou Beiren also encountered, for the first, time the globetrotting and already internationally famous Zhang Daqian (1899–1983).5\n Mount Emei of Sichuan, Zhang Daqian (1899–1983) | Museum of Fine Arts Boston MFA | 53.2389 | 1953   fullscreen   Mount Emei of Sichuan, Zhang Daqian (1899–1983) | Museum of Fine Arts Boston MFA | 53.2389 | 1953    In addition to their common artistic interests, both artists had fled China in 1949 and were additionally connected through their experiences in Japan, Zhang stands out in Hou Beiren’s life as the seminal point of artistic influence, and he was also the artistic figure most closely associated with Hou.\n Hong Kong Memories 香港長憶 | Calligraphy by Hou Beiren | UMAG Collection, Gift of Hou Beiren | HKU.Ca.2019.2460 | 2019   fullscreen   Hong Kong Memories 香港長憶 | Calligraphy by Hou Beiren | UMAG Collection, Gift of Hou Beiren | HKU.Ca.2019.2460 | 2019    Artistic life in Hong Kong in the years prior to World War II had been dominated by Western painting, and this dominance within the galleries and museums continued in the years following the war. However, rapid modernisation in the 1950s, along with the founding of new art colleges and teaching courses, as well as greater exposure by artists to international art trends, led to a marked shift away from such primacy. This trend came to maturity in 1958 with the founding of the Modern Literature and Art Association (Xindai wenxue meishu xie hui) by local artists, including Liu Guosong (b. 1932–), Lu Shoukun (1919–75) and Wucius Wong (b. 1936–), followed by the First Hong Kong International Salon of Paintings held in April 1960 and the Second Hong Kong International Salon in 1962.6\nNotes   Tsang 2004: 181. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Roberts 2016: 38. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n 端木靑. 故國的春天. 港1 版 ed. 九成文藝叢書; 2. 香港: 九成書店, 民國43, 1954.

Exile in Hong Kong","type":"essay","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/HBR/exile_in_hongkong/"},{"content":"In 1956, Hou Beiren and his family were granted refugee status and resettled in the United States. After the passing of the Refugee Relief Act in 1953, the United States Congress had given permission for 5,000 visas to be granted to refugees in Asia, with 2,000 specifically reserved for Chinese with passports endorsed by the Republic of China (ROC).1 Known as the Far East Refugee Program (FERP) of the United States Escapee Program, or more simply as the Far East Refugee Program, this initiative focused on the resettlement of a small number of “bona-fide Chinese political refugees who are identified as being in groups or categories having special political or psychological significance.”2\nHou had been offered resettlement during the initial round in 1953 but declined. He was again offered resettlement in 1956 and, fearing it might not be extended again, decided this time to accept.3 In addition to his political significance as a university educated member of the nationalist elite, Hou’s role as an artist and writer ensured that he stood out from the ordinary mass of poorly educated refugees in mid-1950s Hong Kong, and that he aligned with the positive propaganda goals Dulles saw as being essential.4\nIn November 1956, now aged 39, Hou Beiren, with his wife and two young children, began a new life in Los Altos, in Santa Clara County, California. This region had long established ethnic Chinese communities. In the aftermath of the nationalist retreat to Taiwan from mainland China in 1949, growing numbers of professional, educated and skilled Chinese expatriates and exiles began to relocate to this region from Taiwan and Hong Kong. Hou came to know many of the other nationalist exiles who settled in the region, some of them quite prominent, such as He Fengshan (1901–97), a former Guomindang diplomat who had served in Austria.5\nThe California in which Hou Beiren found himself during the mid to late 1950s was a complex and at times hostile place for ethnic Chinese.6 The Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, prohibiting immigration to the United States by Chinese labourers, had only recently been repealed by the Magnuson Act of 1943.7 The Magnuson Act also made Chinese citizens eligible for United States citizenship, but only gave China an annual immigration quota of 105.8\nShortly after arriving in California, Hou got to know the painter Zhang Shuyi (1901–57) when Hou’s wife began to work in Zhang’s studio in Piedmont, located near Oakland.9 Zhang had arrived in the United States in 1941 to promote Sino-American cultural diplomacy, and he had toured America extensively, holding numerous exhibitions and conducting public demonstrations of his painting, which attracted great public interest and press coverage, arguably becoming the best-known Chinese painter in America at that time.\nWith only limited English, Hou, now known as Paul Hau or Paul P.J. Hau, was faced with few immediate or attractive options for employment and chose to rely on what were now, in this completely new cultural context, his most saleable skills: selling and teaching Chinese ink painting. He began teaching Chinese painting and calligraphy at the Palo Alto Art Club (later the Pacific Art League) in 1957.10 Soon after finding himself in California he began holding exhibitions of his work, which sold well, and it was during this period that his identity as a painter and art teacher became fully established.11\n Pure Wind 风过音清 | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 1960   fullscreen   Pure Wind 风过音清 | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 1960    By 1973, an article in the West Valley Weekend reported that Hou had exhibited in “major galleries throughout the world in China, Japan, Vienna, Austria, New York and at the de Young Museum in San Francisco.”12 He had solo shows at the University of Santa Clara’s de Saisset Museum in 1959 and 1962, at San Francisco’s de Young Museum in 1963, the New Orleans Art Museum in 1964, the San Jose Museum of Art in 1980 and the San Francisco Chinese Culture Centre in 1988.13 By the early 1960s, Hou’s exhibitions had been successful enough to allow him to purchase a home in Palo Alto, which he later named Old Apricot Villa (Laoxing Tang), around which he built a traditional Chinese style garden.\nNotes   Oyen 2014: 196. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Hsu 2015: 172.

Then in 1971, he moved to the Monterey Peninsula at Pebble Beach, near Carmel-by-the-Sea, where he remained until retiring to Taiwan in 1978. Through the 1960s and ’70s, Hou Beiren regularly visited Zhang Daqian, and came to meet and know other Chinese artists who worked in the region. These included the Guangzhou-born Lim Tsing-ai (Lin Qingni, 1914–72); Fu Wenyan (1920–), who also had studied with Zhang Daqian in Shanghai; Fong Chungray (1934–), a pioneering Asian American abstract painter and a member of the Taiwan-based Fifth Moon Group (Wuyue huahui); and the Malaysian-born Cheng Yet-por (1907–91), who lived in San Jose, and whose painting style resembled that of Qi Baishi (1864–1957).\n Zhang Daqian, Hou Beiren and Fang Zhaoling at Zhang Daqian's home in Pebble Beach, California, 1971   fullscreen   Zhang Daqian, Hou Beiren and Fang Zhaoling at Zhang Daqian's home in Pebble Beach, California, 1971    Other artists whom Hou knew included James Yeh-jau Liu (Liu Yezhao, 1910–2003) and Wang Chang-chieh (Wang Changjie, 1910–99), who, along with Cheng Yet-por, all had been trained at the China Art Academy in Hangzhou before fleeing to Taiwan in 1949, subsequently resettling in the Bay Area. These painters regularly exhibited together during the 1960s and ’70s in the Laky Gallery, which was based in Carmel but operated satellite spaces in San Francisco and Los Angeles; in galleries in San Francisco’s Chinatown; and at Lim Tsing-ai’s East Wind Gallery.\n Zhang Daqian and Hou Beiren enjoying the California apricot blossoms, 1971   fullscreen   Zhang Daqian and Hou Beiren enjoying the California apricot blossoms, 1971    In 1973, Hou Beiren and his wife went on to establish their own business, the Chinese Art Gallery, through which Hou sold his work,1 and in 1979—the year in which China and the United States reopened diplomatic relations—he founded the American Society for the Advancement of Chinese Arts ASACA. The organisation's mission was to schedule exhibitions and to facilitate an interchange of ideas and artworks between the US and China.\nAlthough the Asian and Chinese Bay Area ink painters were a disparate group, there are shared qualities—a looseness in their use of ink and roughly textured dynamic brushwork. Also evident is an exploratory engagement with contemporary approaches in terms of technique, subject matter, scale, format and treatment of medium.2 As the most famous living Chinese artist of the period, Zhang Daqian exerted great influence on Chinese painters in Northern California. Michael Sullivan, who served as Professor of Chinese Art at Stanford University from 1966 until 1984, knew many of the Chinese artists in the Bay Area, including Hou Beiren, who he included in his 2006 Modern Chinese Artists: A Biographical Dictionary.3 In 2013, Sullivan and Hou presented a joint talk at the Silicon Valley Asian Art Center.4\n  fullscreen   Mountain Lake's Autumn Colours 湖山春色 | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 1981       fullscreen   On the Path to Yellow Mountain 黃山道中 | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 1982       The legacy and impact of Hou Beiren and other Chinese ink artists based in Northern California was underscored by the 2013 exhibition collaboratively presented by several Bay Area institutions entitled The Moment for Ink.5 This exhibition and catalogue, together with the 2013 Chinese language catalogue publication Yi chi yanshui taipingyang: Zhongguo shuimohua zai Meiguo (A Pool of Ink Stone Water in the Pacific Ocean: Chinese Ink Painting in the United States) mark the inflection point where Hou Beiren’s painting is first situated within the broader current of the new and contemporary Chinese ink painting.\nNotes   Johnson 2016: 8. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Johnson 2016: 20–21.

Bay Area Ink","type":"essay","url":"https://tipeslowly.github.io/HBR/bay_area_ink/"},{"content":"The process of splashed ink landscape painting (pomo shanshui) involves a seemingly unrestrained and arbitrary approach to the application of varying dilutions of ink to paper or silk through a combination of various intensities of spontaneous, semi-intentional and accidental processes that include splattering, dipping and smearing, often using larger brushes heavily loaded with ink that results in an element of chance, to which more deliberate textured brushstrokes can be added in the final stage of the painting so as to transform the gestural abstraction of ink with figures, trees, buildings, bridges and other figurative elements into a representational depiction.\nImplied within the pairing of brush and ink (bimo) is the primacy of the brushstroke, for which there exists a rich and detailed terminological glossary in Chinese painting. This dichotomous push-pull interplay between brush and ink remains evident in Hou Beiren’s paintings, especially his later works, where a constant tension plays out between the figuration of the brush and the abstraction of ink. The aesthetic of splashed ink completely dominates in Hou’s paintings, while the brushstroke is never entirely surrendered or discarded. His brush remains a potently expressive signifier and index of hard-won proficiency within the culturally privileged inheritance of ink painting and calligraphy.\n Mountain Rain 山雨 | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 2002   fullscreen   Mountain Rain 山雨 | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 2002    So too, the constant flux and interplay in Hou’s late work between the underlying layers of shadowy black ink and vibrant overlays of splashed colour create a kaleidoscopic fusion of landscape, cloud, mist and water recalling the primordial chaos (hundun) of early Daoist thought. Incipient matter swirls indeterminately, hovering on the point of coalescing into comprehensible form, with Hou’s paintings fluidly alternating between subject and medium in a manner recalling Impressionist painting.\n Autumn Mountain Covered in Red 秋山紅遍 | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 2001   fullscreen   Autumn Mountain Covered in Red 秋山紅遍 | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 2001    The use of splashed ink occurred only occasionally after the Song period in China and remained largely overlooked within the mainstream of Chinese painting until its revival by Zhang Daqian in Europe in 1956.1 By the mid-1950s, the decline of Zhang’s eyesight due to diabetic retinopathy became one of the factors prompting him to begin experimenting with the technique, since his deteriorating sight no longer permitted him to engage in fine line work.2 It seems likely that, despite claims by Zhang that these compositions were predicated upon well-known Tang and Song dynasty precedents, they were more likely a response to his contact with Western art, most notably Abstract Expressionism in America and the associated non-objective and experiential art movements that dominated the post-World War II art world, such as Gutai in Japan, Fifth Moon Art Group in Taiwan, Tachisme, COBRA and Art Informel in Europe. When Zhang began experimenting with splashed ink painting while visiting Paris in 1956, it is likely that his interest in splashed ink was to some degree motivated by a concern with retrieving China’s artistic past.3\nThe addition of colour in his work began around 1960 and appears to be entirely Zhang’s own innovation, since while texts dating back to the Tang describe painters using splashed ink, none mentions the use of colour, and no examples of splashed ink painting including the use of colour survive prior to Zhang Daqian.4 Colour in his splashed ink painting was central to his compositions, which were built up with rich ink gradations, and not merely a secondary addition after the application of black ink.\n Distant Mountains Covered in Late Winter Snowfall 遠山冬雪未落時 | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 1982   fullscreen   Distant Mountains Covered in Late Winter Snowfall 遠山冬雪未落時 | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 1982    Independently of Zhang, other leading artists also had begun experimenting with splashed ink. Zhu Qizhan (1892–1996) and Liu Haisu (1896–1994) both employed it to varying degrees. Liu Haisu remained in China and so appears to have heard about Zhang Daqian’s work indirectly, with news of his work filtering into the Mainland during the 1970s, when Liu began to employ splashed ink more extensively.5 In common with Liu Haisu, Zhu Qizhan was based in mainland China, but with the opening of China during the Reform and Opening Era (Gaige kaifang) of the 1980s, Zhu was able to travel overseas, and in one photograph, he and Hou Beiren are shown meeting with the American landscape photographer Ansel Adams (1902–84).\n Painter Zhu Qizhan (1892–1996), photographer Ansel Adams (1902–84) and Hou Beiren, May 1983   fullscreen   Painter Zhu Qizhan (1892–1996), photographer Ansel Adams (1902–84) and Hou Beiren, May 1983    Notes   A few late Ming and Qing eccentric painters such as Xu Wei (徐渭, 1521–1593) and Gao Qipei (高其佩, 1660–1734) are among the exceptions. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n See Fu and Stuart 1991: 71–72. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n See for instance Chung 2011: 12. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Fu and Stuart 1991: 262. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Fu and Shen 1991: 235–37. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","id":6,"length":838,"title":"6.

Hou had studied briefly with Huang in Beijing during the summers when he returned home from his studies in Japan.1 Landscape painting remained the dominant theme in Hou’s work, and later in life reminiscences of home evoked through titles, inscriptions and seals became a theme to which he would often return.\nWithin Hou’s work, figurative elements dot his compositions of rivers winding through mountains and forests, along with monumental mountainscapes. In these works, diminutive and isolated figures of wayfarers and mendicants can sometimes be seen picking their way with the aid of a walking staff along remote mountain trails, slowly heading toward some unknown remote destination. Figures drifting in boats gaze up at vast worlds full of pines and mist-shrouded peaks and endless receding ridge lines eclipsing all else.\n Stopping the Boat to Observe Snow on a Clear Day 停舟望晴雪 | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 2001   fullscreen   Stopping the Boat to Observe Snow on a Clear Day 停舟望晴雪 | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 2001    The human presence in Hou’s monumental landscapes is nearly always rendered insignificant and vastly overshadowed by abstracted painterly evocations of nature, reminiscent of the juxtaposition of man and nature found in Northern Song painting. Hou’s landscape subjects are invariably rooted in the traditional literati painting landscapes of the Yellow Mountain and Jiangnan regions, and occasionally include Northern Californian landscapes such as Yosemite, or Switzerland, in commemoration of a trip he and his family made to the Swiss Alps in 1999.\n Picturing Snow-covered Swiss Mountains 瑞士雪山圖 | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 2000   fullscreen   Picturing Snow-covered Swiss Mountains 瑞士雪山圖 | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 2000    Hou’s mountain landscapes remain places of retreat and solitude, the dwelling of mountain spirits and immortals (xian), remote mist shrouded Buddhist monasteries and temples, hidden Daoist cave grottoes (dongtian) and isolated mountain hamlets. The figures in his mind landscapes (xiong zhong qiuhuo) wear the scholar’s robes of the literati and gentry of a now vanished imperial past. They are arguably as much the subject as the landscape they appear in, signifying through their presence that these mountain fastnesses belong within the millennia-plus tradition of Chinese landscape imagery of mountains, bamboo, rocks and pines, which are emblematic of the moral standards and ethical values of the literati of imperial China. These figures connote notions of a withdrawal from official life and politics to pursue self-cultivation and spiritual renewal in remote seclusion.\n Zen and the Sound of Pines 禪罷且聽松 | UMAG Collection, Gift of Hou Beiren | HKU.P.2019.2457 | 2014   fullscreen   Zen and the Sound of Pines 禪罷且聽松 | UMAG Collection, Gift of Hou Beiren | HKU.P.2019.2457 | 2014    Only occasionally does one see a saffron clad Buddhist monk or fishermen in Hou’s splashed ink mountains and rivers. These monumental landscapes are populated primarily by literati wanderers and ascetic hermits who appear custodian-like of these seemingly changeless landscapes—sites of the well-worn reclusive scholar ideal continuously represented across centuries of literati painting and the decorative arts, but still rich and replete storehouses of history, meaning and metaphor. Hou repeatedly draws inspiration from a range of literary figures from China’s past, some of whom he portrays, using their lines and verses of poetry as creative prompts. These are inscribed on the paintings and, in combination with Hou’s seal imprints, provide the paratextual framing of traditional literati painting practise.\nSplashed ink landscapes feature most significantly in Hou Beiren’s artistic practise and output from the late 1970s, and many of the early examples of his work in this mode closely follow Zhang Daqian’s use of intensely saturated washes of blues, aquamarines and greens. In the 1984 catalogue Hou Beiren Huaji (Album of Hou Beiren Paintings), the sixty-one undated paintings are comprised almost entirely of vertiginous landscapes featuring thin, layered washes of ink and colour. A comparatively natural palette comprised of blues, greens and ochre earth tones features heavily.\n  fullscreen   Frost on Autumn Mountain 霜染秋山 | UMAG Collection, Gift of Hou Beiren | HKU.P.2019.2459 | 2018       fullscreen   Picturing Weng Juan’s Poetic Concept 翁卷詩意圖 | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 1981       The relatively small areas of brighter colour first seen in Zhang Daqian’s work, and in Hou’s early splashed ink paintings, expand by the 1990s into larger, looser and more saturated splashes of colour: reds, crimsons, oranges, yellows, bright greens, electric blues and white, as Hou became more and more experimental in both the application of ink and colour in his compositions. In these later paintings, ink and colour are typically gesturally applied or dragged across the painting’s surface in thin and fluid washes, which are then allowed to bleed, puddle and smear, acquiring and building incidental texture, and sometimes creating fibrous capillaries or granular and fractal-like coruscations and scalloped eddies of ink.\n Mount Emei's Three Peaks 峨嵋三頂 | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 1994   fullscreen   Mount Emei's Three Peaks 峨嵋三頂 | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 1994    In some works, ink is loosely flicked onto the surface to provide a texturing effect of flecks and stippling analogous to the use of dots (dian) in traditional landscape painting, but in a looser style of inkblots and splatters that recalls the work of the Qing painter Shitao (1642–1707), whose influence is evident in Hou’s work. Colour and ink sometimes pool and coalesce into dense fissures and darkly opaque blots resembling umbrous cavities and swirls that recall the primordial energies from which rocks and mountains were believed to be formed in Daoist cosmology. In Hou’s work, the resulting landscapes composed of soft organic forms and ragged patches of ink hover on the edge of complete abstraction only to be pulled back into the realm of the figurative with the addition of delineating strokes or trees, figures and buildings—though these tend to be minimal in scale, serving to anchor and orient the viewer in the composition.\n Picturing Bai Juyi’s Poetic Concept 白居易詩意圖 | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 1992   fullscreen   Picturing Bai Juyi’s Poetic Concept 白居易詩意圖 | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 1992    Hou’s technique uses splashed ink in the first stage of the painting to generate a ground of random ink, and a second stage involving the addition of figurative elements through deliberate brushstrokes. Finally, a thin colour wash is added to certain areas of the painting in a third stage to integrate areas of the composition.2 A China Central Television (CCTV) documentary shows footage of Hou painting in his studio, working on a landscape onto which he pours and brushes ink and colour in the gesticulatory first stage, to which in a second stage of more deliberate brushwork he makes figurative additions.3\nIn recent decades, Hou Beiren’s landscape painting has evolved into a recursive and deeply personal exploration of ink painting, displaying a knowledgeable engagement with traditional Chinese art and literature. The titles and inscriptions of his landscapes refer to poets and literary voices from across the past millennium: sources of inspiration whose work provides the lines and verses used as descriptive prompts.\n  fullscreen   Hanshan Walking Slowly, Seeking Poetic Inspiration 寒山漫步尋詩句 | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 2002       fullscreen   Picturing Du Yan's Poetic Concept 杜衍詩意圖 | Collection of the Hou Beiren Art Museum 侯北人美術館 | 2002       Although Hou’s work can be seen to deal with the continuity of the ink painting tradition, it no longer takes its primary inspiration from other paintings or painters, but has become concerned with landscapes of interiority and memory—an individualist art determined not by location but by cultural identity; a cultural identity bound by memory and remaining exclusively rooted in a Chinese vision of nature and landscape.\n Rafts on the Spring River 春江泛舟圖 | UMAG Collection, Gift of Hou Beiren | HKU.P.2019.2456 | 2018   fullscreen   Rafts on the Spring River 春江泛舟圖 | UMAG Collection, Gift of Hou Beiren | HKU.P.2019.2456 | 2018    Over the years his landscapes have become almost metaphysical and fantastical in conception, as fabulous as Penglai, the mythical island of the abode of immortals, or the fabled Peach Blossom Spring (Taohua yuan). Now in his second century, Hou Beiren has continued to paint and to experiment in his work ‘seeking change’ (qiu bian) in the words of one of his recent seals, in the latest stage of a lifelong and intensely personal artistic pilgrimage in ink.\nNotes   See Hou Beiren meishuguan 2014 vol. 2: 275–280. Given the brevity of Hou’s period of study with Huang, combined with the comparatively few published paintings of Hou’s dating from the 1960s and 1970s, a more systematic comparison is not possible. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Yang 1998: 14. \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n The program entitled Hou Beiren Danqing Canran (侯北人丹青燦然) Hou Beiren’s Brilliant Painting, aired on 2 April 2014.
